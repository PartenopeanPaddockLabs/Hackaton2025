It might not be the most exhilarating racing but watching all of the different strategies play out is almost just as interesting.

But in the era of modern F1 — with cars that are larger, heavier, and more aerodynamically complex than ever before — the race around Monte Carlo’s narrow streets is becoming increasingly incompatible with the direction of the sport. The current generation of Formula 1 cars, some over 5.5 meters long and nearly 2 meters wide, are simply too big for Monaco’s tight corners and unforgiving barriers. Overtaking, already difficult under normal circumstances, is virtually impossible without either a significant pace advantage or a driver making a mistake. And, as we saw today, there aren’t enough mandatory two-stop strategies or other gimmicks to change that. If we move past the nostalgia of a bygone era, it becomes clear that this track simply doesn’t make sense in modern F1 — and the same applies to other racing categories, as evidenced by today’s farcical F2 “race.”"",nan,https://www.reddit.com/r/formula1/comments/1kv3r54/what_if_we_admit_monacos_problem_is_monaco_itself/,702,263,0,0,0,post";

But in the era of modern F1 — with cars that are larger, heavier, and more aerodynamically complex than ever before — the race around Monte Carlo’s narrow streets is becoming increasingly incompatible with the direction of the sport. The current generation of Formula 1 cars, some over 5.5 meters long and nearly 2 meters wide, are simply too big for Monaco’s tight corners and unforgiving barriers. Overtaking, already difficult under normal circumstances, is virtually impossible without either a significant pace advantage or a driver making a mistake. And, as we saw today, there aren’t enough mandatory two-stop strategies or other gimmicks to change that. If we move past the nostalgia of a bygone era, it becomes clear that this track simply doesn’t make sense in modern F1 — and the same applies to other racing categories, as evidenced by today’s farcical F2 “race.”"",nan,https://www.reddit.com/r/formula1/comments/1kv3r54/what_if_we_admit_monacos_problem_is_monaco_itself/,558,242,0,0,0,post";
