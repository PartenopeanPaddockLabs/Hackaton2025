But in the era of modern F1 ‚Äî with cars that are larger, heavier, and more aerodynamically complex than ever before ‚Äî the race around Monte Carlo‚Äôs narrow streets is becoming increasingly incompatible with the direction of the sport. The current generation of Formula 1 cars, some over 5.5 meters long and nearly 2 meters wide, are simply too big for Monaco‚Äôs tight corners and unforgiving barriers. Overtaking, already difficult under normal circumstances, is virtually impossible without either a significant pace advantage or a driver making a mistake. And, as we saw today, there aren‚Äôt enough mandatory two-stop strategies or other gimmicks to change that. If we move past the nostalgia of a bygone era, it becomes clear that this track simply doesn‚Äôt make sense in modern F1 ‚Äî and the same applies to other racing categories, as evidenced by today‚Äôs farcical F2 ‚Äúrace.‚Äù",nan,https://www.reddit.com/r/formula1/comments/1kv3r54/what_if_we_admit_monacos_problem_is_monaco_itself/,558,242,0,0,0,post
